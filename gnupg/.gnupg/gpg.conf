# The default key to sign with. If this option is not used, the default key is

# behavior
#-----------------------------

# Disable info screen

# Disable inclusion of the version string in ASCII armored output
no-emit-version

# Disable comment string in clear text signatures and ASCII armored messages
# no-comments

# Display long key IDs
# keyid-format 0xlong

# List all keys (or the specified ones) along with their fingerprints
with-fingerprint

# Display the calculated validity of user IDs during key listings

# Try to use the GnuPG-Agent. With this option, GnuPG first tries to connect to
# the agent before it asks for a passphrase.

#-----------------------------
# keyserver
#-----------------------------

# This is the server that --recv-keys, --send-keys, and --search-keys will
# communicate with to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on
#keyserver hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
keyserver pgp.mit.edu

# Provide a certificate store to override the system default
# Get this from https://sks-keyservers.net/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem
#keyserver-options ca-cert-file=/usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net.pem

# Set the proxy to use for HTTP and HKP keyservers - default to the standard
# local Tor socks proxy
# It is encouraged to use Tor for improved anonymity. Preferrably use either a
# dedicated SOCKSPort for GnuPG and/or enable IsolateDestPort and
# IsolateDestAddr
#
# I run my tor socks proxy in a container, see .dockerfunc and
# github.com/jfrazelle/dockerfiles
#keyserver-options http-proxy=socks5-hostname://torproxy:9050

# Don't leak DNS, see https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2846
#keyserver-options no-try-dns-srv

# When using --refresh-keys, if the key in question has a preferred keyserver
# URL, then disable use of that preferred keyserver to refresh the key from
# keyserver-options no-honor-keyserver-url

# When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys that are marked on
# the keyserver as revoked
# keyserver-options include-revoked


#-----------------------------
# photos
#-----------------------------

# Uncomment this line to display photo user IDs in key listings and
# when a signature from a key with a photo is verified.

#show-photos

# Use this program to display photo user IDs
#
# %i is expanded to a temporary file that contains the photo.
# %I is the same as %i, but the file isn't deleted afterwards by GnuPG.
# %k is expanded to the key ID of the key.
# %K is expanded to the long OpenPGP key ID of the key.
# %t is expanded to the extension of the image (e.g. "jpg").
# %T is expanded to the MIME type of the image (e.g. "image/jpeg").
# %f is expanded to the fingerprint of the key.
# %% is %, of course.
#
# If %i or %I are not present, then the photo is supplied to the
# viewer on standard input.  If your platform supports it, standard
# input is the best way to do this as it avoids the time and effort in
# generating and then cleaning up a secure temp file.
#
# The default program is "xloadimage -fork -quiet -title 'KeyID 0x%k' stdin"
# On Mac OS X and Windows, the default is to use your regular JPEG image
# viewer.
#
# Some other viewers:
# photo-viewer "qiv %i"
# photo-viewer "ee %i"
# photo-viewer "display -title 'KeyID 0x%k'"
#
# This one saves a copy of the photo ID in your home directory:
# photo-viewer "cat > ~/photoid-for-key-%k.%t"
#
# Use your MIME handler to view photos:
# photo-viewer "metamail -q -d -b -c %T -s 'KeyID 0x%k' -f GnuPG"
